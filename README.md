# snowfall
JS Library that lets you easily add multiple animated layers of falling snow to your web page.

Add the following line of code to your web page:
```
<script src="https://orvillechomer.github.io/myCDN/snowfall.js"></script>
```

In your page's JavaScript Setup code include the following line:
```
const snowfall = new Snowfall()
```

That my friends is all there's to it. Your page will have multi-layered animated snowfall on your page!
